# Curriculum

This is meant to be a set of repeatable presentations and code samples that anyone can use to run a workshop at their local meetup, conference, or hackathon. It's purpose is to lower the barrier to entry to giving a presentation by eliminating the upfront work of constructing the presentation itself. 

The target audiance is those who are passionate about Vapor and would like their community to know about it, but don't have the time to sink into creating and perfecting their own presentation.
