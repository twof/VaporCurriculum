# Curriculum

VaporCurriculum is meant to be a set of repeatable presentations and code samples that anyone can use to run a workshop at their local meetup, conference, or hackathon. It's purpose is to lower the barrier to entry to giving a presentation by eliminating the upfront work of constructing the presentation itself. 

The target audiance is those who are passionate about Vapor and would like their community to know about it, but don't have the time to sink into creating and perfecting their own presentation.

## Philosophy
Some guiding principles to remember when contributing to and delivering the presentation:
- Maximize engagement with the participants. Limit lecture time and get participants experimenting as quickly as possible.
- Know your audience. The presentation itself will try to appeal to the widest audience possible, but anyone delivering the presentation should keep in mind who their audience is. Consider providing more technical context if you're leading a workshop for new students or less for industry professionals for example.
- Limit setup time. Provide shortlinks and scripts to workshop participants that make the time needed to get to experimentation as short as possible. If you create any useful tools, consider committing them back to VaporCurriculum.
- Iterate. Get feedback from participants, and consider sharing it as an [issue](https://github.com/twof/VaporCurriculum/issues) so the presentation and associated materials can be improved. Take any feedback received and use it to improve your delivery next time. Most intro to Vapor workshops has historically been similar and only preformed once per presenter. That model provides limited opportunity for iteration and VaporCurriculum is an attempt to remedy that problem.
